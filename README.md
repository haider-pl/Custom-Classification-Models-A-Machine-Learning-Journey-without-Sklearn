1.	Data Cleaning:
•	Handle missing values: Check for missing data in each dataset and decide how to handle them (e.g., imputation, deletion).
•	Remove duplicates: Identify and remove any duplicate records in the datasets.
•	Handle outliers: Detect and deal with outliers if necessary.
2.	Feature Engineering:
•	Encode categorical variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
•	Feature scaling: Scale numerical features to a similar range (e.g., using Min-Max scaling or standardization) to prevent dominance by certain features during model training.
•	Feature selection: Select relevant features based on domain knowledge or through techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance, or dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., PCA).
3.	Data Splitting:
•	Split the datasets into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. Typically, you might use a 70-30 or 80-20 split, or perform cross-validation.
4.	Model Training:
•	Implement Adaboost from scratch: Build the Adaboost algorithm by sequentially training weak learners (usually decision trees or stumps) on weighted versions of the dataset and combining them to create a strong learner.
•	Implement Logistic Regression from scratch: Develop the Logistic Regression algorithm by optimizing the parameters using techniques like gradient descent or other optimization methods.
5.	Model Evaluation:
•	Evaluate the performance of both models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.
•	Fine-tune hyperparameters if necessary to improve model performance.
6.	Saving the Model:
•	Once satisfied with the performance of the models, save them for future use. You can save the trained model parameters or use serialization techniques like Pickle in Python to save the entire model object.
7.	Documentation:
•	Document the entire preprocessing steps, model building process, hyperparameters used, and evaluation metrics for future reference and reproducibility.
By following these steps, you can preprocess your datasets and build Adaboost and Logistic Regression models from scratch while ensuring accuracy and reproducibility for future purposes.
